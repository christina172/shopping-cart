This is a React project to use React Router (client-side routing) and learn React Testing.

This is a website with two pages (created using React Router): Home and Shop. The Home page contains some information about the shop and the products it sells. The Shop page displays the products. Customers can choose how many items they want to buy and add them to cart. The quantity of the products in the cart and the total price are displayed on a sticky bar.
